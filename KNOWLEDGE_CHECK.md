# Lab 08: Knowledge check

**Answer each question below it, in your own words, in one to three sentences.** Replace the `...` below **Your answer:** with your text. Questions 1 and 3 also ask for saved output, which goes into the directory `results/`.

## 1. Slurm: what jobs have I submitted?

**Your task:** print a history of all your Slurm job submissions *since November 4, 2026*. Format the output to include the job ID, job name, node list, partition, account, user, state, start time, and elapsed time. See the job accounting fields in the [sacct documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sacct.html). You may also ask Claude Code or another LLM for the exact command. 

Redirect the command's output to `results/job-history.txt` and include the file in your submission. Do not worry if some earlier jobs failed or were canceled. The complete history should show your process, including trial and error.

*Hint:* See [Part 1, Step 6](README.md#step-6-check-how-the-tasks-ended) in the README.

**Your answer:** Provide the entire command you used, including all CLI options.

sacct -X -S 2026-11-04 --format=JobID,JobName,NodeList,Partition,State,Start,End,Elapsed,ExitCode > results/job-history.txt

## 2. Slurm: did every array task run at the same time?

You submitted your entire job array with one `sbatch` command, but Slurm scheduled each task separately.

**Your task:** in the job history from Question 1, find the tasks from your most recent completed array run. Compare their start times and elapsed times.

*Hint:* See [Part 1, Step 5](README.md#step-5-watch-the-job-array) in the README.

**Your answer:** Did all tasks in the array start at the same time? Was the elapsed time identical for every task? Explain why or why not.

No the tasks did not all start at the same time, when we look at task 22831177 we can see that it started around 18:22 and finished at 18:50 with the task running accross 18 waves. the elapsed times were similar but not identical with roughly 13 to 18 seconds of rruntime.

## 3. Slurm: did my job use what it asked for?

Suppose your next job array has 1,000 books instead of 101. Before you submit it, you want to know whether your script asks for too much or too little memory and time.

**Your task:** run `seff` for **one** task of your finished job array, and save its output as `results/seff.txt`.

*Hint:* `seff` takes the ID of one task, such as `4211873_1`. Compare its **Memory Utilized** and **Job Wall-clock time** with `--mem` and `--time` in your `summarize.slurm`.

**Your answer:** How much memory and time did the task use, compared with what your script asked for? What would you change in your script, and why?         

for my main task it used roughly 2.59gb of memory which is 16% of the 16gb allocated from the original script. Time wise it was 16 seconds per task which was about 5% of the 5 minute limute that was set. for a 1000 book task instead of 101 I wouldnt increase the memory as each task is still going to use the 2.59gb so it would be better to lower the memory and time requirements.
